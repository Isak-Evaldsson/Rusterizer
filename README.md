# Rusterizer - A software rasterizer in rust
A lite hobby project with the purpose of learning more about 3d graphics and rust. It also works great for procrastinating my advanced computer graphics course exam :)

## License
Since it's a hobby project I license it under MIT, basicly do whatevery you want as long as you give credit to the author

## Contribution
I consider it highly unlikley, but if anyone stumbles into this project and want contribute with something cool, feel free to do a pull request

## TODO list
Somewhat order in priority
* Perspective projection
* Clipping
* SIMD acceleration (primarily in vector types)
* Better pixel iteration in rasterizer
* Multi-thread rasterizer
* Some kind of programable fragment shaders (initially compiled with program, maybe in future compiled in runtime like a real graphics driver)
* Support for loading obj files
* Make some kind of game
* General performance improvements
