# Rusterizer - A software rasterizer in rust
A lite hobby project with the purpose of learning more about 3d graphics and rust. It also works great for procrastinating my advanced computer graphics course exam :)

## TODO list
Somewhat order in priority
1. Perspective projections
2. Better pixel iteration in rasterizer
3. Multi-thread rasterizer
4. Some kind of programable fragment shaders
5. Support for loading obj files
6. Make some kind of game
7. General performance improvements
